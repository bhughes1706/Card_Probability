# Texas Hold'em Continuing Probabilities Trainer

Texas Hold'em probabilities trainer. This program provides probabilities of achieving specific types of hands based on what the user has in their hand during the game. The program will ask a random question about the hand each turn, allowing the user to evaluate their hand and guess the probability of the event the program asks about.

Probabilities given mid-hand are exact to the hundredths of a percent. This program does not employ iteration to analyze probabilities of certain types of hands, but uses simple statistical modeling. However, to achieve the probability of beating a random hand, iteration was used.

****Possible further design elements****
--Track user's ability to guess the probabilities of their hand in random situations to show what they're weak in
--Implement probability guessing with differing opponenet group sizing
